My name's Taimoor Ahmad and I study Computer Science at Ryerson University in Toronto, ON. I was born in Pakistan but
have lived my entire life in Toronto. My hobbies include racquet sports (Badminton, Squash, once in a while Table Tennis
and Tennis), Starcraft II, simracing and more.

I have experience programming web apps and SaaS products such as [Geo Link Tool](https://geolinktool.com) and
[Face Blur Tool](https://faceblurtool.com). I am currently looking for remote work and contract work. I have experience
with Node, Express, React, Stripe, REST APIs, MongoDB, Python, Javascript, Java, Kotlin and more. If you'd like to hire
me, see [my portfolio](/portfolio).

I also run a YouTube Channel called [Taimoor Codes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9_2rdTefiAnSpOz9NMe9QA) where I
teach programming and share a few personal thoughts from time to time.

I run this blog to share my programming knowledge to fellow programmers and help them out. From time to time I also post
personal articles relating to my life, my thoughts, productivity, lifestyle and more.
