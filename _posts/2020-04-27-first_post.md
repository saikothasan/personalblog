I just renamed my YouTube Channel to ["Taimoor Codes"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9_2rdTefiAnSpOz9NMe9QA) and I
try to upload 1-2x per week there. I think that YouTube is the ultimate platform for creating content since it's so easy
to find an audience, HOWEVER it does take a long time. So I figure if I'm going to be writing scripts anyways, I can
also create an accompanying blog. Sometimes I come up with a video idea and never go through with it because it's too
simplistic and doesn't deserve and entire video (YouTube does indeed avoid promoting less than 10 minute in my
experience).

In this post I want to sort of have a public list of priorities so I can hold myself a bit more accountable to Getting
Things Done (tm).

-   [Taimoor Codes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9_2rdTefiAnSpOz9NMe9QA) - My YouTube Channel
    -   Upload one "talking head" video (3 hours/week)
    -   Upload one tutorial video (5 hours/week)
    -   Need to also do some chores (2 hours/week)
-   [Geo Link Tool](http://geolinktool.com/) - A geo based URL shortener Software as a Service
    -   Need to overhaul the UI with more pages and start a blog (appx. 16 hours)
    -   Minor chores for the website (2 hours/week)
-   [Face Blur Tool](https://faceblurtool.com/) - A tool for censoring faces and an API as a Service
    -   Need to overhaul the UI with more pages and start a blog (appx. 16 hours, but doing Geo Link Tool first should
        shorten this)
    -   Minor chores for the website (2 hours/week)

There are 112 waking hours per week (assuming 8 hours for sleep). 40 of those can go to a day job (I have a job
interview in 2 hours, please pray for me). I want to spend at least 3 hours per day relaxing (I'm buying parts for a
gaming PC so I can play Starcraft II again), 112 - 21 = 91. The above should put me at 10 hours per week for YouTube and
4 hours per week for my current projects, 91 - 14 = 77. If I want to pursue another project (I have a really good idea
for one!) I should have time to pick it up.

I don't know what the point of this article was. They say that planning is the ultimate form of procrastination. It is
probably true!
